## Data assimilation using Generative Adversarial Networks to determine COVID-19 infection risks in enclosed spaces using autoencoders for compression

## Project Description

This project contains to apply AI model that is built on the results from CFD simulations to predict the \ch{CO2} distribution within a room based on \ch{CO2} sensor data that is limited and observations from field campaign based on different non-linear dimensionality reduction methods, and it is combined with data from sensors that are located in optimal spatial locations to improve accuracy of the models from AE-based ROMs to predict the risk of airborne COVID infection within a room.
